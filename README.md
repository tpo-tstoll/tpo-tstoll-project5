# tpo-tstoll-project5
This project fetches a list of 12 random employees from an API. You can click on the populated worker cards to read more about a specific employee. Once viewing the employee info, you can navigate to the subsequent or previous employee by clicking the available buttons or exit out of the window and choose a new emplee once again by selecting their worker card. Although this list only populates 12 employees, you can still use the search bar to complete real time filtering based upon the employees first or last name or click the search icon to submit a search.

I also adjusted the background color of the page to a light to dark blue gradient. This change gives more appeal to the page while maintaining readability.
